## Project Sought

My background, whether from previous co-op's or personal projects,  revolves around building out full-stack applications that have something to do with data analysis or data visualization. I have found great interest in being able to take large amounts of confusing or unused data and turning it into something easily digestable and easily consumed by others. My ideal capstone project would be something that follows this same path.
