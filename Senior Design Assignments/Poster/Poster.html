                    <p>
                        This project is a sentiment analysis and aggregation web application. Users can search
                        for any set of keywords (e.g. a brand name or topic) and they will see a graph of
                        public opinion regarding their search. The result data presented to the user is
                        constructed from social media posts that are processed through a natural language
                        processing engine. Users will see public sentiment changes over time and can break down
                        results by social media platform.

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>
                        Currently, there are many existing solutions to perform Sentiment Analysis to
                        differentiate between positive and negative text. For this project, the goal was
                        to utilize Natural Language Processing to create our own engine that will determine
                        the overall sentiment trend of keywords across a variety of social media. This tool
                        can then be utilized to provide further insight into decision making for marketing
                        executives and others in that respective industry.

                    <h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>
                    <p>
                        The methodology of the Sentiment Analysis engine used in this project is based on
                        a very large pre-classified dataset and a BiLSTM neural network. Many different
                        options were tested in this context, such as basic word scoring, Naive Bayes,
                        Logistic Regression, and multiple types of neural networks. By incorporating the
                        Universal Sentence Encoder from Google to create embeddings, the BiLSTM was able
                        to be trained using the Sent140 dataset from Stanford, a dataset containing over
                        1.6 million text objects. The final classification rate for the test data was over
                        80% for the 100,000 records tested.
