                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are plenty of tools that allow users to assess the amount of interest in a topic
                        over time but provide no insight as to how people feel about that topic. To Google
                        Trends, there is no difference between a spike of excitement and a spike of anger. As
                        a consumer, brand manager, or investor, gauging sentiment can be as important as
                        gauging interest, so this is a crucial lack of information.

                    <p>
                        This project is a sentiment analysis and aggregation web application. Users can search
                        for any set of keywords (e.g. a brand name or topic) and they will see a graph of
                        public opinion regarding their search. The result data presented to the user is
                        constructed from social media posts that are processed through a natural language
                        processing engine. Users will see public sentiment changes over time and can break down
                        results by social media platform.

                    <p>
                        The React web interface handles user interaction and formats the data on the fly based
                        on the user's selections. The Node routing server manages communication between the web
                        interface, social media platforms, and the sentiment analysis engine, concurrently
                        making requests to different servers to minimize delay. The Python engine API receives
                        all of the social media data, schedules it for analysis by the sentiment analysis engine,
                        and aggregates the results. The Python sentiment analysis engine interprets the sentiment
                        of social media posts and generates a score for each one based on how positive or negative
                        it is.

                            A robust Sentiment Analysis API that allows the analysis part of our application to run
                            standalone without the need for a frontend

                            Network to build a classifier with nearly 80% sentiment accuracy. Classifier was trained
                            using 1.6 million record data set

                        <li>
                            Create a customizable date range for the sentiment graph. This will allow users to
                            view trends over a longer period of time.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Show users more statistical analysis of the sentiment data. This will help differentiate
                            between a change in sentiment and statistical noise.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add a homepage with popular search results pre-populated. This will engage users and
                            show them how others are using the platform.

                        <li>
                            Implement targeted sentiment analysis. This will enable our engine to assess the
                            sentiment of text with respect to the search terms.
