# Getting Started

The Sentiment Analysis Tool lets you explore weekly sentiment trends related to a set of keywords on social media. These are the supported social media platforms:

- Twitter
- Reddit

## Search page

The search page has a search bar where you can enter a query. This query is searched against the supported social media platform, and related posts from the past week are scored based on their sentiment.

## Results page

Once you perform a search, the results page is displayed. The search bar is still present, and each time you search, the results data is updated. Below the search bar, a list of hashtags related to your query are displayed. Each hashtag is a link to related posts on Twitter.

At the bottom of the page, there is a graph displaying sentiment over time for your query on the supported social media platforms. This reflects how positively users on the platform feel about the keywords you are exploring. A score of 50 means that users feel neutral or conflicted about the topic. Higher scores reflect more positive sentiment, and lower scores reflect more negative sentiment.
